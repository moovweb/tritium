State: Development

CHANGES:
  * No more asset.2 (warnings gone!). Must use asset.1
  * export.2 is now really export.1 { set(@2) } now. That means you can yield properly to export and set a dynamic value
  * regex() is now regexp()
  * use SET=classic instead of TESTSET when running tests
  * replace() is now replace_regexp() and replace_text()
    * macros sort it for you -- unlikely that users will ever use the two specific methods
  * Big changes to the automated tests...
    Used like this...
        # Require the test framework...
        require 'tritium/engine/test'
        # Inside my tests
	include Tritium::Engine::Test::Gauntlet
  * match() now returns "true" and "false"
