Gokogiri
by Zhigang Chen and Hampton Catlin

A pretty straightforward and simple library for using LibXML in native Go.

This is a major rewrite from v0 in the following places:

    - Separation of XML and HTML
    - Put more burden of memory allocation/deallocation on Go
    - Fragment parsing -- no more deep-copy
    - Serialization
    - Some API adjustment

To install

    - sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
    - go get ../../gokogiri

To run test

    - go test ../../gokogiri/html
    - go test ../../gokogiri/xml
