" Specifies a target (specified by **%target**) to be searched. To be used in conjunction with `with()` - [click for example](http://console.moovweb.com/learn/training/function_guides/match). @example `match($path) { with(/product/) }` will match the path of the url to see if the regular expression 'product' matches."

# @name match
# @category Environment,Text
# @scope Global
# @args Text %target
# @description
# The `match` function is used for pseudo-logic in Tritium. With `match()`, you have the equivalent of `if-else` and `case` statements in many other programming languages. `match` is used to test the content of variables with strings, regular expressions, and other variables, then run code according to whether or not the match is successful.
# **Things to note**: If you have more than one variable or regular expression to test againt, you can simply provide the match function with the variable in question and then use embeded with() statements for each case. You can also provide a final else() statement to serve as a catchall for all unsuccessful matches.
# ### Common Uses
# * Matching the `$path` of the incoming request and `@import` a corresponding Tritium script.
# * Matching attributes with certain content to determine if they need to be changed in some way.
# * Simulating `if-then-else` statements and boolean (`true-false`) logic to run differing Tritium.
# * Matching the `$status`, `$content-type`, or other information from the incoming headers.
#
# In the following example, we match the `$path` variable to see if it matches the regular expression `/product/`. Since it does, the log "Match successful!" will output to the terminal.
# @example
# $path = "product"
# match($path) {

# The `not` function is used inside a `match()` statement as an opposite to the `with()` statement. In other words, if the match is not successful, the code inside the `not()` block will run, whereas if the match is successful, the code will be skipped over.
# ### Common Uses

# In the following example, we match the variable `$var` with the `not()` statement of "Match You". Since that statement does not exist in the variable, the `log` inside the `not` statement will be executed.

# @description
# The yield() function is used to tell Moovweb where you want a new scope to be opened when using this function.

# To learn more, check out [our helpdesk post on how yield works](http://help.moovweb.com/entries/21633781-what-does-the-yield-function-do).
# Common uses include:
# * Any time you need to execute code after someone uses your function.
# * Error checking your function's use cases.
#
# In this example, we first define a function that yields to a scope before our log() statement. This means if the user changes the $a variable, then the log statement will change as well.
# However, in our second example, we log our variable $a before yielding, which means that even though the user's changes will take place. The variable will be logged before it is changed. So in our second example we will see "dog" rather than "dogcat".

# @description
# The `regexp` function is used to parse `%expressions` and turn them into regular expressions. Regular Expressions are incredibly powerful for selecting and modifying groups of text.
# **Things to note**: The `%options` input provides flags for the regular expression such as `i`, which indicates it should be case insensitive.
# ### Common Uses
# * Removing extra text when transitioning from desktop to mobile sites.
# * Modifying text to be more clear and concise to fit a smaller viewport.
# * Changing instructions such as "click" to "tap" for mobile devices.
# * Fixing malformed HTML before the document is parsed so your selectors work properly.
#
# In the following example, we use the string "true" and turn it into a regular expression to use in a `match-with` statement. We are also accepting any combination of upper and lower case because of the `i` flag. If the string "true" is anywhere in the text we are matching, the code in the `with()` statement will run.
# @example
# $var = "123456"

# ### Common Uses
# * In `log` statements when outputting some combination of variables and description of those variables.
# * When selecting elements based on variables or attributes, they may need to be formatted properly using the concat function.
# * When manipulating text scopes and combining the content of several scopes.
#
# In this example, we fetch the `ID` of the div with the `ID` "my_div", then we `log` a `concat` statement to the terminal output.

@func Text.replace(Regexp %search) Text Text

" Replaces all instances of the text **%search**. This yields to a Text scope that allows you to set the replacement string using `set()` - [click for example](http://console.moovweb.com/learn/training/function_guides/replace). @example `replace(\"bad\") { set(\"good\") }`."
# @abstract Opens a scope to all instances of the regular expression provided that you can then `replace` using the `set()` function.
# @name replace
# @category Modify,Text
# @scope Text
# @args Text %search
# @description
# The `replace` function is used to alter existing text nodes by replacing them based on either regular expressions or specific strings.
# **Things to note**: Unless otherwise specified by the Regular Expression, all matches found by the `%search` parameter will be replaced.
# ### Common Uses
# * Replacing desktop instructions like "click" to mobile instructions like "tap"
# * Removing extra or unnecessary text
# * Rewriting attributes based on some standard `set` via a regular expression.
#
# In this example we are replacing the text "Replace Me" inside `#my_div` with the text "Replaced!".
# @example
# $$("#my_div") {
#   text() {
#     replace("Replace Me") {
#       set("Replaced!")
#     }
#   }

" Adds **%text_to_prepend** to the beginning of the text. @example Given `<div>Dog</div>`, `$(\"./div\") { text() { prepend(\"Super-\") } }` will change the text to 'Super-Dog'."
# @abstract The prepend function adds the input text to the beginning of the text scope from which it is called.
# @name prepend
# @category Modify,Text
# @scope Text
# @args Text %text_to_prepend
# @description
# The prepend function is used to insert text at the beginning of a text scope.
# ### Common Uses
# * Categorizing content by attaching labels or other forms of organized tags.
# * Numbering content using the prepend() function in combination with the index() function.
#
# In this example, we prepend a sentence onto the beginning of the text node inside "my_div".
# @example
  $$("#my_div") {
    text() {
      prepend("This is how you prepend text in front of the existing text in #my_div.")
    }

" Captures all instances of the regular expression **%search**. "
# @abstract The `capture` function grabs all instances of the regular expression specified.
# @name capture
# @category Modify,Text
# @scope Text
# @args Regexp %search
# @description
# The `capture` function is used to grab a specific block of text, which is matched via a regular expression.
# ### Common Uses
# * Grabbing specific items from a string of text
# * Separating out capture groups in a regular expression
#
# In this example, the capture function will grab any string of 8 characters and log it the terminal.
# @example
  $$("#my_div") {
    text() {
      capture(/(\w{8})/) {
        log("Words with more than 8 letters: " + %1)
      }
